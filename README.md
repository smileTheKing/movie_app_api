# React + Vite
This is a movie lookup app built using React + Vite + Tailwind. You can use it to search the library for a movie and get a brief description of it (movie description, runtime, star rating, movie genre, director and writer).


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Run commands:
first run
    -npm install

 than run this
    -npm run dev
